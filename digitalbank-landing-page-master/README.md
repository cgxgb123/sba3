## Overview

My challenge was to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

The only JavaScript required is for the mobile navigation toggle. However, you could also try doing this without JS.

Your users should be able to:

View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Reflection

During this project, my biggest struggles were making my navigation bar display correctly and controlling how my images affected my layout. At first, my navigation bar wouldn’t stay in the correct position, it either overlapped other elements or the links wouldn’t space evenly. I also had issue where large images in the “Latest-article” section caused my pages to extend endlessly. While fixing the navigation bar and experimenting with “justify-content", I discovered setting the width to 100% to fit within the container its inside of instead of using its absolute size. Inspecting elements in the browser helped me see these changes live and helped a lot. If i had more time, I’d improve my overall layouts responsiveness. On some screen sizes the phone image begins to overlap  words on the page.
